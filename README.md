This was created during our time as students at [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/)
# Crystal Clear application
[This app](https://mizu-view.herokuapp.com/) tells the story of mymizu's impact in Japan and the world through stunning real-time dynamic, visualizations. 

## Motivation 
There are many great organizations striving to tackle climate change. However, people can have trouble understanding the significance. We built Crystal Clear to show how important reducing your plastic bottle usage is.
